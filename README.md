Project Overview
Welcome to our B.Tech major project, where we worked on simplifying the complex calculations involved in converting an image into a cartoon using deep learning.
Our solution makes this process more efficient by using image processing techniques implemented in MATLAB.

The idea is to take a regular image and turn it into a cartoon version by applying various filters and techniques—without getting bogged down by
the heavy computations that deep learning often requires. The result? A faster, more streamlined cartoonization process that still maintains high-quality output.

This project was guided by Mr. D.Y.S. Ponselvan, whose support and expertise helped shape our work.

What the Project Does
Our MATLAB-based tool:

Takes a standard image as input and converts it into a cartoon-like version.
Uses a combination of image processing techniques, including edge detection, color quantization, and smoothing filters.
Reduces the need for deep learning while still producing detailed cartoon images.
In simple terms, we focused on making things simpler, without losing the quality of the output.

How to Get Started:
Prerequisites
You need to have MATLAB installed on your system.
Steps to Run:
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/MuralibvN6/Major-Project)
Open the cloned folder in MATLAB.
Load your image into the workspace and run the provided .m scripts to process the image.
Examples
Original Image:
Cartoonized Image:
These examples show how an image transitions from a regular photograph to a cartoon-style image using our MATLAB code.

Why We Did This
Deep learning can sometimes feel like overkill when it comes to things like cartoonizing images. By focusing on traditional image processing techniques, we’ve managed to simplify the task, making it more efficient without compromising on the final product’s quality. This project can be a great starting point for anyone looking to learn image processing or experiment with basic MATLAB operations.
